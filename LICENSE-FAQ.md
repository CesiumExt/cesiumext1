I still don't know which license applies, can you repeat?
CesiumExt1 is GPLv3, but you have the right to use it and extend it with a Sencha ExtJS Commercial License under BSD.

The license you choose depends on the license of the framework ExtJS you use with it. If you are creating open source applications and you are using the GPL v3 version of the Ext JS framework, then the appropriate CesiumExt license is the GPL v3 license for CesiumExt. If you are creating closed source applications and you are using the commercial version of the Ext JS framework, then the appropriate CesiumExt license is the BSD license for CesiumExt, which can be combined with the commercial version of Ext JS for a closed source application.
